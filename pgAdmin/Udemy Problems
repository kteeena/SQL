I figured this double JOIN out all on my own, and was so proud of it, as it wasn't exclusively taught in the Udemy lesson.

Problem: "Get a list of all the movies actor "Nick Wahlberg" has been in.

I went over this for so long, becuase it seemed there was not enough info from two of the tables to answer this question, but instead from three tables.
Given a double-join had not been introduced to me yet, it was not an obvious option. But I tried it anyway. Here is the query and it worked!!

SELECT first_name, last_name, film.title FROM actor
JOIN film_actor 
ON actor.actor_id = film_actor.actor_id
JOIN film
ON film.film_id = film_actor.film_id
WHERE actor.first_name LIKE 'N%' AND actor.last_name LIKE 'W%';

This yielded 25 rows of results, all including first name Nick, last name Wahlberg, and the movie titles corresponding to this actor. 

Though this is not perfect, I was proud. 

Going over my query, a better way to search the actor's name would've looked something like this, to elimanate any duplicates of actors whose 
names may have started with the first letters: WHERE first_name = 'Nick' AN last_name = 'Wahlberg';
This would've been much simpler and proficient, but hey, I'm still happy as a newbie.
